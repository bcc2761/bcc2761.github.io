            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I’m a Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology (B.S.) passionate about applying technology to solve real-world problems—from sustainability & healthcare to scientific computing. <br><br>
            I take pride in being a collaborative team player who enjoys tackling complex challenges, learning new tools quickly, and growing by connecting with peers and mentors. <br><br>
            At SAIC, I contributed to national research efforts by building CLI tools and optimizing HPC workflows using Python, Fortran, Azure, and Slurm. I’ve also developed full-stack applications with Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and .NET, and I’m especially interested in bridging technical solutions with positive global impact. <br><br>
            Outside of software, I’m expanding my perspective through coursework in digital business/MIS and an immersion in Japanese language and culture, both of which deepen my appreciation for global collaboration and interdisciplinary problem solving. I’m currently seeking internship, co-op, or research opportunities—domestically or abroad—where I can contribute to meaningful projects, expand my skillset, and collaborate with driven teams. <br><br>
